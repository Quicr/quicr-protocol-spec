Recently new use cases have emerged requiring higher scalability of 
media delivery for interactive realtime applications and much lower latency 
for streaming applications and a combination thereof.

draft-jennings-moq-arch specifies architectural aspects of
QuicR, a media delivery protocol based on publish/subscribe metaphor
and Relay based delivery tree, that enables a wide range 
of realtime applications with different resiliency and latency needs.

This specification defines the protocol aspects of the QuicR media
delivery architecture.
